    <h3>Handling</h3>

    <p>You'll get the most enjoyment from your vinyl recordings if you use the 
    proper care. Avoid touching the playing surface of any record. Handle the 
    record on its side edges only. Don't leave your records in a horizontal 
    position. When you are not playing a record, store the record in a 
    vertical position in a record rack in its protective sleeve. Don't use a 
    plastic or metal rack to store your records unless you have placed the record 
    first in its protective sleeve.</p>

    <h3>Cleaning</h3>

    <p>Clean your disks frequently, particularly after you have played a recording. 
    You want to ensure there is no damage from dust and static, and you want to make sure that 
    you will be storing your disks safely as well. We stock a wide variety 
    of cleaning materials and cloths for eliminating dust and static from your 
    records. Above all, do not use tap water, which might contain harmful 
    minerals and chemicals, to clean your records. Use either spring water or a 
    water-based solution that contains not more than 20% isopropyl alcohol. 
    Cleaning solutions are very effective at removing dust, dirt, and other 
    contaminants that the record may have encountered, especially during the handling 
    process. Clean the disk in the direction of the grooves, never against the 
    direction of the grooves, which might cause tiny particles from the cleaning cloth to collect 
    on the recording surface.</p>

    <h3>Storage</h3>

    <p>You want to get the longest life from your records, so the proper storage of 
    your records is key to maintaining the enjoyment of your records for years to 
    come. Consider the temperature and humidity of the room where you will be 
    storing your records. Store your records in an environment that will be 
    heated in winter and cooled during the summer. Don't store your records in 
    an attic or a garage, where temperature extremes might cause warping or other 
    damage to the record. An environment of 60-70 degrees is best, and 
    humidity in the range of 33-50%. You don't want your records being damaged 
    by heat or humidity. Never store your records where there is any exposure 
    to sunlight. Also be mindful of other room factors that might affect the 
    heat level next to the disks, such as heaters, vents, air conditioners, and 
    lighting. Avoid dusty environments such as an attic or basement. 
    Keep your recordings (vertically) in an airtight container, a cabinet with 
    doors, or a sealable box. If your home or apartment has an open-floor 
    layout, be mindful that smoke and cooking greases from the kitchen or outdoor 
    barbeques can affect your records as well.</p>

<h2>Kitchen</h2>

<p>We are so happy with our new kitchen! The layout is perfect for cooking a large meal or fixing a quick snack. When we entertain, our guests often gather in the kitchen while we prepare the meal. We love the natural light that streams in from the windows!</p>

<h2>Living Room</h2>

<p>The living room is the social center of the house. We have enough room to stretch out and watch TV or to entertain guests for a fun evening of board games or movies. We've decorated in neutral colors so the atmosphere is calm.</p>

<h2>Bathroom</h2>

<p>The bathroom has a wonderful spa feeling. What a great room to unwind at the end of the day and freshen up.</p>

<h2>Bedroom</h2>

<p>The bedroom is large enough for a king sized bed plus dressers. It doesn't have a sitting area. There is plenty of storage space for clothes.</p>

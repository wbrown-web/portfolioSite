<h1>Bent Brick Welcomes You</h1>

<h2>Welcome to Our New Web Site</h2>

<p>Bent Brick has been the leader in selling brick, stone, and other masonry in 
the Atlanta area for more than 50 years. Of course, we are known throughout this 
area as being the primary seller of our special preformed curved brick. Our products 
are noted not only for their beauty, but also for their durability. We offer a 20-year 
guarantee on every product we sell. We don't just sell the finest brick and stone, 
we also install it. We will come to your site and plan your project from start to 
finish. Let our expert designers and masons take care of every detail of your project. 
We know that these days both residential and commercial properties have both eyes 
on the budget, so we will work with you to create a package that meets not only 
your structural needs, but also your financial needs as well.</p>

<h3>New Product Offered</h3>

<p>We are proud to begin selling our QwikStone&trade; slab stone product. QwikStone only 
has to be mixed with a little H20 in order to produce a pourable brick slurry that 
can be formed into any shape you want. QwikStone comes in a variety of colors that 
can suit your every design need. We are the only sellers of this product in this 
region. QwikStone can withstand very high psi levels, which means that this product 
will not crack or crumble even when placed in very high-traffic areas. Best of all, 
QwikStone sells for less than half the price of comparable brick and stone products. 
Drop by and see it for yourself. It will make a lasting impression on you!</p>

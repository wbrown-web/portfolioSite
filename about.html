            <div class="text-justify">
            <p>I'm not sure exactly where to start, as it is always difficult to talk about yourself. But, I spose I
                will tell you a little about myself. I'm a fun outgoing person that loves to have a good laugh. I enjoy
                doing anything that involves being around a lot of people. I also have a love/hate relationship with
                Iowa State Athletics.
            </p>

            <p>Some of my vices include binge watching shows on Netflix or Amazon, and have seen
                most seasons of pretty much every popular TV show. I also like to go to the Movie Theatre to watch the
                newest movies. When I had more time, I also really enjoyed playing video games. (Some of which I played
                way too much of at certain points of my life). I still play a little every now and then when I find the
                time.
            </p>

            <p>I spent a majority of my life working in restaurants and have basically done every job inside of a
                restaurant, from cooking to bartending to management. As a result, (although it doesn't really show) I
                love food. I really enjoy dining out at restaurants, and even try to pick one that I've never been to
                before on occasion just to try it out.
            </p>

            <p>More recently I worked as an IT recruiter. I really enjoyed the people I met and the people I worked
                with. In the end I realized that although meeting new people and the work was great, I had a passion to
                be on the development side instead of being the guy that recruited the developers. I had done a tiny bit
                of Web Development in high school and decided that I really did have a passion for it. I think the main
                reason I really enjoy it is that I really like to learn new things. When I was recruiting I learned that
                it was a field that was ever changing, and in a lot of cases pretty rapidly. Giving me an opportunity to
                be continously learning. I also like the idea of being able to create something for a lot of people to
                enjoy and make their lives easier.

                <img class="img-fluid" src="main_images/iowa_state.png">
            </div>
            <div class="text-justify">
            <p>I graduated from Iowa State with a Marketing Degree. Being in sales was something that I had always
                thought I wanted to do. I think the main reason was because I really enjoy meeting new people, learning
                their story, and building those relationships. I also was always a talker, so it was something I felt
                really fit. Though, when I was actually in a sales position, I quickly learned that making a bunch of
                phone calls a day wasn't something for me. Meeting new people was great, but for the most part the day
                to day was really mundane for me and didn't seem to provide the challenges I craved.
            </p>
            <p>After some deep soul searching in December of 2016, I decided it was time to listen to my heart and go
                back to school for Web Development at DMACC. So I quit my job as an IT recruiter and enrolled in classes
                for the Spring Semester of 2017. So far classes have been great, and I have really enjoyed it. Come
                December 2018 I will have completed all of my courses.
            </p>
            <p>I currently have a working knowledge of HTML/CSS, Bootsrap, SASS, WordPress, Photoshop, and I would say a
                fairly decent understanding of vanilla JavaScript. I look forward to learning more JavaScript as it is
                what I have enjoyed the most.
